delay
- 150 was just a little bit inconsistent when rolling keys such as "as" and "er"

layers
- perhaps make a layer chooser or something that can consistently toggle layers without the need of an on screen display or something to indicate which layer you are on


superwide
-basically want to make it so my pinkys do a lot less work
  - less reaching
  - less holding shift
move tilde to lctrl
lalt could become tab?
  - holding lalt (tab) could be a layer toggle
maybe hold space for shift?
